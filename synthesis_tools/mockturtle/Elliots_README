I needed to upgrade my version of gcc to get cmake to work with this library, so if you get errors trying to build this that may be the problem


the test program I've been using is currently in 
test/algorithms/mig_algebraic_rewriting  .. cause laziness

building test:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DMOCKTURTLE_TEST=ON ..
make
./test/run_tests
